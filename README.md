# OmniBot

OmniBot is a comprehensive bot that we use in Omniversal for a variety of functions. Using a bespoke bot, we are able to stay more cohesive compared to a combination of bots, many which have duplicate functions.

The bot is intentionally coded to work in Omniversal and is not hostable in other servers without modifications.
