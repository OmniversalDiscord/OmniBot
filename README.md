# OmniBot

OmniBot is a comprehensive bot that we use in Omniversal for a variety of functions. Using a bespoke bot avoids the common issue of duplicate commands when many different bots are used together, and thus provides a more cohesive and simple experience.

The bot is intentionally coded to work in Omniversal and is not hostable in other servers without modifications.
